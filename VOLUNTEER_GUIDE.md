### "My changes aren't showing on the website"

- Wait 60 seconds, then refresh the page
- Try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

### "I made a mistake!"

- Click on the item you edited
- Look for previous versions (if available)
- Or just edit it again and republish
- All changes are tracked - nothing is permanently lost

### "I can't find the editor buttons"

- Try making your browser window wider
- The editor is responsive and hides buttons on small screens

### "Can I see what it looks like before publishing?"

- Yes! Click the eye icon (👁️) to preview
- Opens in new tab showing how it will look

- Post at least monthly
- Include photos when possible
- Keep it positive and community-focused
- Tag location when relevant

### Projects:
- Update status when things change
- Include volunteer opportunities
- Add completion dates when finished

### Photos:
- Use your own photos when possible
