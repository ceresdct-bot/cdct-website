We're delighted to launch the new Ceres & District Community Trust website!

This new platform makes it easier for community members to:
- Learn about our current projects
- Sign up as volunteers
- Become members
- Support our work through donations
- Stay updated with news and events

The website is managed by our volunteers and will be regularly updated with news about our activities and opportunities to get involved.

**Have feedback about the site?** We'd love to hear from you at info@cdct.org.uk

Thank you for your continued support of our community!
